Introduction
Binary trees are fundamental data structures in computer science and are used for various purposes, including searching, sorting, and expression parsing. This repository provides implementations of binary trees in different programming languages along with various algorithms and operations that can be performed on them.

## Features
.Binary Tree Creation: Create binary trees with custom nodes and values.
.Traversal Algorithms: Implement and visualize different tree traversal algorithms, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
.Search Operations: Implement search algorithms to find nodes within the binary tree.
.Insertion and Deletion: Perform insertion and deletion operations on the binary tree nodes.
.Balancing: Implement balancing algorithms such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees.
